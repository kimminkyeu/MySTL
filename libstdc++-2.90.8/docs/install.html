<!-- ####################################################### -->

<H2><A NAME="prereqs">Tools you will need beforehand</A></H2>
   <P>You will need a recent version of g++ to compile the snapshot of
      libstdc++:  gcc-2.95.2 works well.  You
      will need the full source distribution to whatever compiler
      release you are using.  
   </P>
   <P>In addition, if you plan to modify the makefiles or regenerate the
      configure scripts:  automake (version 1.4 from Cygnus, not the one on
      the net. It's available 
<A HREF="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/libstdc++/000215-automake.tar.gz">here</A>
      and autoconf (version 2.13 and higher), which is available 
    <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.13.tar.gz">here</A>.
   </P>
   <P>If you don't have bash, and want to run <TT>'make check'</TT> to
      test your build, you'll need to get bash 2.x. Also recommended
      is GNU Make, since it is the only 'make' that will parse these
      makefiles correctly.
   </P>
   <P>Finally, if you are using cygwin to compile libstdc++-v3 on
      win32, you'll have to get a version of the cygwin.dll that is
      dated on or after February 1, 2000. This is necessary to
      successfully run the script "mknumeric_limits" which probes the
      floating-point environment of the host in question--before this
      date, Cygwin would freeze when running this script. In addition,
      you may want to get a current version of libtool (say
      libtool-1.3.4 and above) as earlier versions supposedly had
      problems creating shared libraries.
   </P>

<H2><A NAME="config">Configuring the library</A></H2>
   <P>How you configure the library depends on whether you want namespace
      std:: to be enabled:
      <UL><LI>If you are enabling namespaces, you'll need to configure
              the entire GCC source directory, not just libstdc++.  This
              will enable the build directory to have both gcc and 
              libstdc++ directories, and thus libgcc.a can be rebuilt:
      <PRE>
    cd <EM>blddir</EM>
    <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>/configure --prefix=<EM>destdir</EM></PRE>

          <LI>If you don't care about this, and want to just rebuild
              the library, you can configure just libstdc++ but you must
              pass in '--disable-namespaces --disable-libgcc-rebuild' on
              the configure line, like so:
      <PRE>
    cd <EM>blddir</EM>
    <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>/libstdc++/configure --prefix=<EM>destdir</EM>
        --disable-namespaces --disable-libgcc-rebuild</PRE>
   </UL></P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="install">Building and Installing the library</A></H2>
   <HR WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE>
   <P><EM>As the libstdc++-v3 sources and the core GCC sources move
      towards convergence, more and more effort goes to building the
      library as the default version to be shipped with g++.  With
      the 2.90.8 snapshot, this is treated as the usual scenario.  If
      you want to build the library all by itself, you will need to
      explicitly disable certain features (like namespaces) since
      the core GCC library, libgcc.a, will not be rebuilt with those
      same features.
   </EM>
   </P>
   <HR WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE>

   <P>Go into the source distribution for the compiler.  For instance,
      <TT>gcc-2.95.2</TT> is a valid name.  This directory will be
      referred to as <EM>gccsrcdir</EM> in the rest of this document.
      Once in <EM>gccsrcdir</EM>, you'll need to rename the directories
      called <TT> libstdc++ </TT> and <TT> libio </TT> like so:
      <PRE>
      mv libstdc++ libstdc++-v2
      mv libio libio-v2</PRE>
   </P>
   <P>Next, unpack the library tarball into this directory; it will
      create a directory called <TT>libstdc++-<EM>version</EM></TT>.
      This directory will be referred to as <EM>libsrcdir</EM> in the
      rest of this document:
      <PRE>
   gzip -dc libstdc++-version.tar.gz | tar xf -</PRE>
   </P>
   <P>Finally, make a soft link between <EM>libsrcdir</EM> and
      <TT>libstdc++</TT> so that libstdc++-v3 will be the default C++
      library used.
      <PRE>
   ln -s <EM>libsrcdir</EM> libstdc++</PRE>
      This complexity of having two completely separate libstdc++
      libraries is necessary so that you can unlink <EM>libsrcdir</EM>
      and update the compiler sources.  If you're not this adventurous, or
      would not like to switch between different C++ standard libraries,
      this extra effort is probably wasted; just remove the v2 sources.
   </P>

   <P>Now you have two options:</P>

   <H3>[re]building <EM>everything</EM></H3>
   <P>If you're building GCC from scratch, you can do the usual
      <TT> 'make boostrap' </TT> here, and libstdc++-v3 will be built
      as its default C++ library.  The generated g++ will magically
      use the correct headers, link against the correct library
      binary, and in general using libstdc++-v3 will be a piece of
      cake. You're done.
   </P>

   <H3>[re]building only the libraries</H3>
   <P>If you already have g++ installed and just want the new libraries
      , the rest of this page is for you.
   </P>
   <P>You must have a recent snapshot release of gcc built (tested with
      gcc-2.95.2), and massaged your PATH variable so that it is used for
      the building of the library.  To check your PATH, you can run
      <TT>'which g++'</TT> (for csh-family shells) or <TT>'type g++'</TT>
      (for ksh or bash).  To check the exact version of the compiler,
      run <TT>'g++ --version'</TT>.
   </P>
   <P>Now, on to building!  It's recommended that you create a separate
      build directory apart from the source directory for the building
      of the library; this will be assumed for the 
      rest of the instructions.  This build directory will be called
      <EM>bld-libstdc++</EM> in the rest of this document.  Create and
      'cd' into this directory.
   </P>
   <P>It is also recommended
      that libsrcdir should not be the parent directory of bld-libstdc++,
      nor vice versa, i.e., the closest they should be is sibling
      directories.  This will be assumed for the rest of this document.
   </P>

   <P>If you're rebuilding the GCC library along with libstdc++, you
      can go into your GCC builddir and run &quot;make all&quot; (a
      subset of &quot;make bootstrap&quot;).  This will build a whole
      bunch of other things that you probably didn't want, but will also
      configure and compile the library, under the
      <EM>gccbuilddir/cpu-vendor-OS/</EM>libstdc++ directory.  The core
      libgcc.a will also be rebuilt.
   </P>
   


   <P>If you're not rebuilding the GCC library, or you just have it
      located in a different place, then you can
      run the configure script out of the libsrcdir directory.  You can
      pass many options to configure that will affect its behavior; for
      the more interesting ones, run <TT>'configure --help'</TT> and see
      the section
      <A HREF="configopts.html">Interesting <TT>configure</TT> options</A>
      below.  At minimum, you should specify where to install the library
      using the --prefix option:
      <PRE>
   <EM>libsrcdir</EM>/configure --prefix=$HOME/new_libstdc++_install</PRE>
      The installation directory will be referred to as <EM>destdir</EM>
      in the rest of this document.
   </P>







   <P>Installing the library is simple.  Go into your
      <EM>bld-libstdc++</EM> directory, and run:
      <PRE>
   make install</PRE>
   </P>
   <P>This will create the <EM>destdir</EM> directory and populate it
      with subdirectories:
      <PRE>
   lib/
   include/g++-v3/
      bits/
      backward/
      ext/</PRE>
   </P>
   <P>You can check the status of the build without installing it using
      <PRE>
   make check</PRE>
      or you can check the status of the installed library using
      <PRE>
   make check-install</PRE>
      These commands will create a 'testsuite' directory underneath
      <EM>bld-libstdc++</EM> containing the results of the tests.  We are
      interested in any strange failures of the testsuite; please see
      <A HREF="faq/index.html#2_4">FAQ 2.4</A> for which files to examine.
   </P>

      <A HREF="index.html">to the homepage</A>.
   </P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="solitare">Building and Installing the library (without GCC sources)</A></H2>
   <P>This method will soon be unsupported, and after that it will
      be actively discouraged.  If you keep trying to build the library
      by itself, doing so will get harder and harder, and if you persist,
      right-thinking people everywhere will shun your company, and
      small children will fear you.
   </P>
   <P>First you'll need to supply configuration infrastructure files
      that would normally be supplied by GCC:  install-sh, mkinstalldirs,
      missing, ltconfig, ltmain.sh, config.guess, and config.sub.
   </P>
   <P>You should read over the &quot;normal&quot; installation
      instrutions above to get a feel for the procedure.  You will need
      to use a build directory that is separate from the source
      directory, but if you're attempting this step, we assume that you
      already know these things.
   </P>
   <P>You <EM>must</EM> pass at least these two options when you run
      the 'configure' script:
      <PRE>
   --disable-namespaces  --disable-libgcc-rebuild</PRE>
      You cannot rebuild the GCC library since you don't have the sources,
      and you cannot build a std::-supporting library because doing so
      currently requires that you rebuild the GCC library.
   </P>
   <P>After that, 'make' and 'make install' should function as any other
      GNU-type package.  You can now go to the section about using the
      library below.
   </P>

      <A HREF="index.html">to the homepage</A>.
   </P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="usage">Using the library</A></H2>
   <P>Assuming that just the library was built (ie the directions for
   [re]building only the libraries), you'll have to do three things to
   use the library:
   <OL>
   <LI><B>Pick up the new include files at compile time</B>
       <P>Add <TT>-I<EM>destdir</EM>/include/g++-v3</TT> to the command
          line for each file you compile.  This will pick up the new
          editions of <TT>&lt;string&gt;</TT> and so forth.
       </P>
       <P>If you want the SGI extensions (like hash tables), you can
          add <TT>-I<EM>destdir</EM>/include/g++-v3/ext</TT> and/or
          <TT>-I<EM>destdir</EM>/include/g++-v3/backward</TT>.
       </P>
   <LI><B>Link against the new library at link time</B>
       <P>Add <TT>-L<EM>destdir</EM>/lib</TT> to the command line when
          you produce an executable.  The g++ driver already links
          against libstdc++.a; this will just make it find the new one.
       </P>
   <LI><B>Find the new library at runtime (shared linking only)</B>
       <P>If you only built a static library (libstdc++.a), or if you
          specified static linking, you don't have to worry about this.
          But if you built a shared library (libstdc++.so) and linked
          against it, then you will need to find that library when you
          run the executable.
       </P>
       <P>Methods vary for different platforms and different styles, but
          the usual ones are printed to the screen during installation.
          They include:
          <UL>
          <LI>At runtime set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your environment correctly,
              so that the shared library for libstdc++ can be found and
              loaded.  Be certain that you understand all of the other
              implications and behavior of LD_LIBRARY_PATH first (few
              people do, and they get into trouble).
          <LI>Compile the path to find the library at runtime into the
              program.  This can be done by passing certain options to g++,
              which will in turn pass them on to the linker.  The exact
              format of the options is dependant on which linker you use:
              <UL>
  <LI>GNU ld (default on Linux):<TT>  -Wl,--rpath -Wl,<EM>destdir</EM>/lib</TT>
  <LI>IRIX ld:<TT>  -Wl,-rpath -Wl,<EM>destdir</EM>/lib</TT>
  <LI>Solaris ld:<TT>  -Wl,-R<EM>destdir</EM>/lib</TT>
  <LI>More...?
              </UL>
          </UL>
       </P>
       <P>Use the <TT>ldd(1)</TT> utility to show which library the system
          thinks it will get at runtime.
       </P>
   </OL
